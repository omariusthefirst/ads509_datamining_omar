Shoot My Shot

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Shoot My Shot"
(from "Space Jam: A New Legacy" soundtrack)
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish
Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip?
You can try, but you ain't taking me alive
You ain't taking me alive
So gimme my spot, I ain't gon' sit
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
You ain't never seen no one do it like this
If you say you did then you's a lie
You ain't takin' me alive
I believe I can fly
I believe anything could be achieved when applied
Gotta reach for the sky
Wanna do it but I never had a reason to try
Do you believe in a lie?
Want something so bad it could eat you alive
I see the grief in your eyes
Pray the opportunities might reach you in time
But I came too far to give up now
Worked too hard to get stuck now
Every corner I turned I was turned down
Had to look at my life like what now?
Can't express myself, I shut down
Ain't no one left, it's just us now
Just me and myself and my buss down
Momma couldn't pay rent, but we up now
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish
Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip?
You can try but you ain't taking me alive
You ain't taking me alive
So gimme my spot, I ain't gon' sit
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
You ain't never seen no one do it like this
If you say you did then you's a lie
You ain't taking me alive
I been thinking 'bout this since I was young
And I fell in love and I was sprung
I know you gon' miss me when I am gone
Ooh lord, I'ma die a legend like 24
RIP to the 24
When I was cold I was moving with the wind, yeah
Might of fell, but I'm doing it again, yeah
Just a kid I was shooting at the rim, yeah
They wasn't there when I was shooting in the gym, yeah
You wasn't there when I was hooping in the pen, yeah
New year, but I feel like I been here
New year, now I'm cruising in the Benz, yeah
New year, but I feel like I been here
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish
Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip
You can try, but you ain't taking me alive
You ain't taking me alive
So gimme my spot, I ain't gon' sit
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
You ain't never seen no one do it like this
If you say you did then you's a lie
You ain't taking me alive
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
I'm gon' splash, I'm gon' swish
Oh, you wanna stop my water, my drip
You can try, but you ain't taking me alive
You ain't taking me alive
So gimme my spot, I ain't gon' sit
Shooting my shot, I ain't gon' miss
You ain't never seen no one do it like this
If you say you did then you's a lie
You ain't taking me alive
