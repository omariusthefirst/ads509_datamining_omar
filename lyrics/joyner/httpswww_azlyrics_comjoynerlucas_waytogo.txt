Way To Go

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Way To Go"
(feat. Snoh Aalegra)
I got pain in my soul (way to go)
And I ain't prayed in so long (I said way to go)
Jesus can't save me no more (way to go)
Just remember the road
You feel like the world is a gangster, you feel like you had a bad case of the "can't help it", you feel like sometimes all hope is gone and every time you wanted to do good, evil was always prevalent on you. You hear me? He came to kill, steal and destroy your soul and now you look at yourself and you say, "I just got pain in my soul".
Ugh, I ain't felt this way since Wednesday
I brought a switchblade to 6th grade
Way before Myspace and Sam-space
I had a crush on BeyoncÃ© and Kim K
I went to work late and missed out
My Grandma told me, "In ten days you're kicked out"
Never went to Sunday School, I skipped out and then went to the mall and got draped up and tripped out
I used to listen to Bon Jovi and hang with my Aunt Rosie, then she called the cops on me
Crack in my socks runnin', my neighbor up top sold me
Nowhere to run nowâthanks a lot homie
Misunderstood, trust me I know what you took from me
She said, " I know you're in a relationship and you couldn't love me
And you know we got something and you know it's time
So what you waitin' for?
Goddamn you let me down again, way to go
I got pain in my soul (way to go)
And I ain't prayed in so long (I said way to go)
Jesus can't save me no more (way to go)
Just remember the road
I came to tell you tonight that there's good news that Jesus came to save you from all of your sins and he came to wash it away with his blood. The enemy came to steal, kill and destroy your soul and now all you can do is that in your soul, is that there is nothing but pain.
Ugh, niggas just throw fits, I'm so sick
I'm tired of my broke friends who smoke cigs
I just wanna gold Benz with with smoke tens
And take all of my hoes on a road trip, just no kids
I guess it's cool to dream when you ain't used to havin' much
I know this breakup hurtin' you and you sad and such
I know you not happy, stop actin' like you havin' fun
I know you snoopin' through my Instagram gettin' mad as fuck
I tried to run away from home before the ass-beatin's
All I wanted was some clothes, but it's tax season
I love it when they Black, but they act 'Rican
My pastor think that I'm half Black and half Demon
What the fuck is you tryin' for? What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine and I'm down for, we ridin' for it
We wanted this a long time ago, what you waitin' for?
Goddamn, you let me down again (way to go)
I got pain in my soul
Way to go
And I ain't prayed in so long
Way to go
This sinnin' can't save me no more
Way to go
This the end of the road
I got pain in my soul
Way to go
And I ain't prayed in so long
Way to go
This sinnin' can't save me no more
Way to go
This the end of the road
I got pain in my soul
Way to go
Ta-ta ah ah ah ah ah
Why-yy yy yy
I ain't prayed in so long
Way to go
Sinnin' can't save me no more
No more
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
Man, think about a little baby girl and a baby boy. Man makes them happy, to carry, to carry heavy load. Lord.
