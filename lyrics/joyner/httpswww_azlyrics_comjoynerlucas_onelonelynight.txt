One Lonely Night

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"One Lonely Night"
Yo, what's up, this is Joyner
I'm not able to take your call right, leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you
Peace
You told me not to take there
I swear god, man I was supposed to make it here
Ahhhh, I was supposed to make it here
Ahhhh
Close your eyes when you pray at night
But all the money in the world couldn't save your life
Ahhhh, money couldn't save your life
Ahhhh
What you gon do when the club close down
And the liquor runs out, and your all by yourself
What a lonely night
One lonely night
What you gon do when the weed don't ease your brain
And numb your pain like it used to
That's one lonely night
One lonely night
Hennessy by the bottles, double D's on the models
Plenty trees, we can have as many dreams as we want to
That's my life, Ay-ya-ya-ya
I'ma be alright, Ay-ya-ya-ya
Gold teeth and some Benzs, Twenty-twos and some bitches
Strip clubs every night, that's the life that I'm livin'
And it mine Ay-ya-ya-ya
I'ma be just fine Ay-ya-ya-ya
What you gon do when the party close down
And the drugs run out and your all by yourself
What a lonely night
One lonely night
What you gon do when the pills don't ease your brain
And numb your pain like it used to
That's one lonely night
One lonely night
I just want some weed now
I let you in and all you did was let me down
Ahaaa, let me down
Ahaaa
Close your eyes when you pray at night
But all the money in the world couldn't save your life
Ahhhh, money couldn't save your life
Ahhhh
Hey what's up, It's me
Um, I know you're probably not expecting to hear from me right now but
I just left the club and I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little drunk
I really don't want to be alone tonight
So would you come over?
[Sighs]
I shouldn't have even went out tonight, like
I've just been so lost lately, there's been so much on my mind
But I miss you
Please call me back, you're like the only one I can talk to, for real
I love you, I'm so lonely please baby
Hennessy by the bottles, double D's on the models
Plenty trees, we can have as many dreams as we want to
That's my life, Ay-ya-ya-ya
I'ma be alright, Ay-ya-ya-ya
Gold teeth and some Benzs, Twenty-twos and some bitches
Strip clubs every night, that's the life that I'm livin'
And it mine Ay-ya-ya-ya
I'ma be just fine Ay-ya-ya-ya
What a lonely night
One lonely night
Oh shit, oh shit
Here we go again, make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
You gon' take this dick while I press record, and tonight you my slave don't you ever tell me no again
So don't you ever tell me no again, bitch I'm possessive and I never let you go again
Who hittin' you phone at two in the morning and had to tell that nigga don't you ever text my hoe again
Said don't you ever text my hoe again, look nigga I don't care how long you been friends
I don't care if you knew each other since you was kids
Bitch, I don't care if your little brother is cool with his
I'm the shit, oh shit, where the noise at
Everybody got a squad, can't avoid that
Niggas screaming "Gang, Gang, Gang," oh yeah
But when the shit hit the fan, where your boys at?
Oh shit, oh shit, I don't have a visa
I think I'mma fall in love with a ballerina
Just let me hit it and I ain't waitin' for marriage neither
Cause she gon' fall and I'm gon' ball like alopecia
I said I gone bald like alopecia, I turn the god, then read the Bible the grabbed the heater
I want a mansion in Hollywood and Pasadena, but I still ain't got shit and I ain't too happy neither
And everything was all good just a week ago. I heard some shit about you I ain't believe it tho
'Cause I don't listen to the gossip or tea and go and treat your differently cause niggas wanted me to know
That's for you to guess and me to know
Shorty said I'm cold hearted my shit 3 below
I just ran into the bank, give me all the bread, I didn't want to do it but I need the dough
Oh shit
Here we go again, make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
You gon' take this dick while I press record, and tonight you my slave don't you ever tell me no again
[Crying]
Shut the fuck up hoe
Look don't you ever tell me no again, bitch I'm possessive and I never let you go again
Who hittin' you phone at two in the morning and had to tell that nigga don't you ever text my hoe again
Cause I'm possessive and I never let you go again
Hah
Don't you ever call my phone again
Yo, yo, Hello, you
The fuck?
Waoorreeooree
