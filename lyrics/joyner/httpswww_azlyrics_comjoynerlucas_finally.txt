Finally

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Finally"
(feat. Chris Brown)
[Joyner Lucas:]
Got a hundred million things all on my mind
Every damn thing, new day, new fight
Always runnin' in and outta my life
Hell no (Hell no)
But I won't let you back in this time
I won't let you back in my mind (Yee)
I won't let you blame me this time
Hell no (Hell no, no)
[Chris Brown:]
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me
I don't mind it (No, no)
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me
And I like it
[Joyner Lucas:]
And they used to always tell me, "You ain't nothin' special" (Woo)
Dammit, he done took it to another level (Yeah)
I was patient, you was dangerous, I was young and mellow
Congratulations, you done turned me to a fuckin' rebel (Yeah)
Yeah, I've been peeped by how you move like some new luggage (New luggage)
Used to love you back when we were boo lovin' (Woo)
That was way before I seen ya fuckin' true colors (Yeah)
Always poppin' shit and I ain't even do nothin' (Joyner)
Tryna play me like we unofficial (Unofficial)
You got other issues (Other issues)
I done held you down when nobody fuckin' with you
Once you close a door, don't you let it fuckin' hit you
And I'd be lyin' if I told you I was gonna miss you
I ain't chasin' that (Nah)
I just made a stack (Stack)
I gave you the world, now I gotta take it back
I gave you the world, now I gotta fade it black (Oh, shit)
I lost it all, but I made it back
Got a hundred million things all on my mind
Every damn thing, new day, new fight
Always runnin' in and outta my life
Hell no (Hell no)
But I won't let you back in this time
I won't let you back in my mind (Yee)
I won't let you blame me this time
Hell no (Hell no, no)
[Chris Brown:]
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me
I don't mind it (No, no)
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me
And I like it (Ooh)
[Joyner Lucas:]
Okay, I'ma do me, you do what you gotta (Yeah)
I'll go where I want, ain't gotta tell you nada (Nope)
I been hustlin', I been cookin' up the Betty Crocker (Woo)
You been strugglin', you be chasin' after every dollar
And I used to be around, now I'm cold-blooded (Cold-blooded)
I'm just petty, I ben holdin' onto old grudges (Old grudges)
Oh, you think you know, but you don't know nothin' (Nah)
Oh, you opinionated, who you think you are? Joe Budden?
I still think you do the most though (Most though)
Now I'm ghost though (Ghost though)
I'm like, "Nigga, I still got my fuckin' mojo" (Mojo)
You love the drama, and I think you need your own show (Yeah)
If you call me, it's a no call, no show (No call)
Baby, I ain't chasin' that (Buck)
I just made a stack (Buck)
I gave you the world, now I gotta take it back (Take it back)
I gave you the world, now I gotta fade it black (Oh, shit)
I lost it all, but I made it back
[Joyner Lucas (Chris Brown):]
Got a hundred million things all on my mind
Every damn thing, new day, new fight
Always runnin' in and outta my life
Hell no (Hell no)
But I won't let you back in this time
I won't let you back in my mind (Yee)
I won't let you blame me this time
Hell no (Ooh, hell no)
[Chris Brown:]
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me
I don't mind it (No, finally)
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me (Ooh)
You do you, I'll do me
And I like it (Ooh)
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me
You do you, I'll do me (I, I)
I don't mind it (No, no)
Finally, I can fly and be free and be me (Ooh)
You do you, I'll do me (Do what you wanna)
And I like it
