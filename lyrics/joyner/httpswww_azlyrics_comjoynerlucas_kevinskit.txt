Kevin (Skit)

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Kevin (Skit)"
[Kevin Hart:]
Listen, Joyner what's up? Heard the song "Lotto" you just dropped, and I'ma tell you right now man, I'm not too impressed. I'll tell you why I'm not impressed, I'll tell you why. Because you still owe me money from a year ago, when your bitch ass cryin' about your Lamborghini you repossessed, until I came to the rescue, had to be asked, "Come save a hoe," to maintain, your lil' bitch ass, fake ass lifestyle. Now, if a year later, I still don't have my money and you're rapping about hittin' the lottery. Tell me, where the fuck do they do that shit at? I don't, I don't know. You think 'cause I'm 5"2' I can't box? I'm 5'4", I'll whoop your ass, swear to God. Picture your ass whooped by a munchkin. Let me tell you something, Joyner. I don't care how short I am, or what I sit on a rollercoaster at DisneyWorld, if I was you, I'd get back to me immediately, 'cause if you don't I'm gonna beat your ass with a Lil Uzi Vert album. I swear to God, ha, I swear to God. What are you, white? What the fuck is this, slavery? Rap 'rations? Still chase you down. Give me my shit!
