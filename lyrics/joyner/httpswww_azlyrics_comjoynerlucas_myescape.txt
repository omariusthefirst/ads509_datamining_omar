My Escape

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"My Escape"
Yeah, yeah
Shorty, shorty, shorty
Look, look, look
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, I'm the realest one I know, tell them niggas not to play, ayy
I got secrets that I'm taking to grave, ayy
Sixteen first time I caught a case
Selling crack tryna get the fuck up out my momma's place, ayy
Niggas trapped, I was plotting my escape, ooh
Gettin' high, we was lockin' out of space, ooh
I ain't perfect, might've a few mistakes
Might've cheated on my bitch, but I know she woulda stayed, ooh, ooh
Look, I'm ill-matic with a street dream
I'ma independent one man street team
Told my bitch keep the dishes and the sheets clean
I keep the pot full 'cause my son can't eat steam
I'm just tryna keep my feet clean
Snitch niggas they be tryna keep the streets clean
Why you niggas buy clothes full of cheap seams?
I'ma shoot porn for the generic delete scenes
I'ma suffer for the wrongs that I remember
Wrong address, the karma get brought to the sender
In a room full of artists, I get brought to the center
Shots to the arm, sound like a fork in a blender
My money talk, but you don't want to talk to the vender
My money long, the only thing short is my temper
I drive by the showcase cartin' in a fender
I'm lucky that the law never caught through your fender
They tell me I learned everything the hard way, ugh
If I make it to the charts it'll be a long way, yeah
Now I look up at the charts and see an entrÃ©e
Now I look up at the charts and see a parfait
Y'all lookin' in the mirror and see Andre
Now I look up in the mirror and see Na, J and Dame or part Dame, way before it all changed
Way, way before the part when rockets fell a part Wave
Look, I'm the realest one I know, tell them niggas not to play, ayy
I got secrets that I'm taking to grave, ayy
Sixteen first time I caught a case
Selling crack tryna get the fuck up out my momma's place, ayy
Niggas trapped, I was plotting my escape, ooh
Gettin' high, we was lockin' out of space, ooh
I ain't perfect, might've a few mistakes
Might've cheated on my bitch, but I know she woulda stayed, ooh
I keep the feinds real far from where the pills are
I keep the re-up money far from where the bills are
Achieved a lot of goals to finish life still far
I heard beggers can't be choosers, but you still are
I can smell it through a motherfuckin' steel jar
I ain't had no time to cook it so it's still raw
Thou shall not kill, is that a real law?
'Cause I killed some of them niggas, but I wanna kill more
Should I get a drill or hack 'em with a steel saw?
I got low, but the fuck niggas still saw
The beats old, there's no peace that was still war
You been broke, ten years later and you still poor
I only write raps still 'cause I feel bored
But ADHD still made it to the Billboard
A lot of y'all were goaltending, but I still scored
And don't be gettin' in on shit that you ain't built for
'Cause we the realest, yeah, we the realest, yeah
Quich 'n tell a motherfucker what the deal is, yeah
Oh, you got the juice? Don't spill it, yeah
You gon' end up like Old Man Quillis, yeah
Make a nigga pay the price, I'll bill it, yeah
Turn the little fuck nigga to a sparin' chair
Push a nigga way back, I'll pill it, yeah
Make gunshot a ho with a skillet, yeah
Look, I'm the realest one I know, tell them niggas not to play, ayy
I got secrets that I'm taking to grave, ayy
Sixteen first time I caught a case
Selling crack tryna get the fuck up out my momma's place, ayy
Niggas trapped, I was plotting my escape, ooh
Gettin' high, we was lockin' out of space, ooh
I ain't perfect, might've a few mistakes
Might've cheated on my bitch, but I know she woulda stayed, ooh
