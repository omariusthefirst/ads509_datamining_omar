Dreams Unfold

Joyner Lucas & Lil Tjay Lyrics
"Dreams Unfold"
[Joyner Lucas:]
Yeah-yeah (Joyner)
Up in that, I'm way too, I'm way too lit
Up in that, I'm way too lit, up in that, I'm way too
I'm way too lit up in that hoe
Heart so hard, I get that dough
They want work, come get that smoke
Hop out the trunk, you hear that blow
That's your bitch, come get that hoe
She wan' suck me, get that throat
I'm way-way up, don't give no fucks
I lost my heart, like "Where that go?"
This ain't no game, I'm in that zone
No X's and O's, no tic-tac-toe
I crossed my heart, don't hope to die
But if I do, don't let that go
I pray my soul don't get that cold
My jewelry freezin' in that snow
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold
That's the truest shit I know
Keepin' that blicky by my side
Tryna take my shit, you gon' die
Never try to come here, 'round here
And it's a homicide
All I got is money on mind
Shawty in love, guess I'm a vibe
I'm a motherfuckin' dime
Yeah, you know I love the sign
Yellow diamonds, lemonade (Woah)
I'm a fuckin' renegade (Woah)
Pistol singing animate (Woah)
I hope you prepare the play (Woah)
Massachusetts born and raised (Woah)
But I get love in Saint Tropez (Woah)
You stand on me and get the "Grra-grra" (Woah)
Turn your brain into creme brulee
Game on, bullets come down, get rained on
Too much for you to hate on
Crabs in the bucket tryna hang on
Too much sauce on A1
Real nigga since day one (Joyner-Joyner)
Tryna be love like Faizon
I'ma die a legend like Trayvon
I'm the only motherfucker in this lead
I step in this bitch, I'm poppin', I know
Any other nigga try to stand in my way
I turn his whole face into Cotton Eye Joe
Any other nigga that stoppin' my glow
I'm way too drippy on top of my boat
I'm a real ass nigga, but I lie to my hoe
Can't keep my dick inside of my clothes
Like how did I know?
I'm way too lit up in that hoe
Heart so hard, I get that dough
They want work, come get that smoke
Hop out the trunk, you hear that blow
That's your bitch, come get that hoe
She wan' suck me, get that throat
I'm way-way up, don't give no fucks
I lost my heart, like "Where that go?"
This ain't no game, I'm in that zone
No X's and O's, no tic-tac-toe
I crossed my heart, don't hope to die
But if I do, don't let that go
I pray my soul don't get that cold
My jewelry freezin' in that snow
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold
[Lil Tjay:]
You can't say I ain't the man
Shift from poverty and now look where I am
Lookin' better at everything and like "Damn"
Now walk off the line, that's word to my hand
I'm just a young kid, I'm a young nigga
With some Rollies and millions of fans
My bitch delusional, this ain't no xan
I was just thuggin' that motherfuckin' can
Thought I'd be nothin', nothin'
We gon' sharin', said mama don't panic
Gone storm tourin' out Atlantic
Gotta work hard or this money can vanish
So that's why I be puttin' in work
Then forever they gotta see damage
I be slayin' shit until they banned it
I had to take it when nobody hand it
My shit been goin' all like how I planned it
Know the oppositions be like "Damn it"
Been some minutes, I ain't had to scam shit
Comin' to that money ever so romantic
Couple millions where I reside
Born to hustle, you see it in my eyes
Had a month where a couple niggas tried
But then I revised, for Bentley's? I strive
Niggas be talkin' like they with the shits
See 'em in person, pressin', no reply
Nigga say he with it, say he lyin'
But I know I'm the realest, put on that provide
And that savage pumpin' in my heart
I got money, lowkey should be dried
Traumatized, I steady wonder why
Like fuck with you niggas bitches for your guys (Bitches for your guys)
[Joyner Lucas:]
I'm way too lit up in that hoe
Heart so hard, I get that dough
They want work, come get that smoke
Hop out the trunk, you hear that blow
That's your bitch, come get that hoe
She wan' suck me, get that throat
I'm way-way up, don't give no fucks
I lost my heart, like "Where that go?"
This ain't no game, I'm in that zone
No X's and O's, no tic-tac-toe
I crossed my heart, don't hope to die
But if I do, don't let that go
I pray my soul don't get that cold
My jewelry freezin' in that snow
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold
