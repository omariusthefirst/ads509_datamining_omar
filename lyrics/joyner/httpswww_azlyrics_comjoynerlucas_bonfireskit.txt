Bonfire (Skit)

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Bonfire (Skit)"
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Oh my fucking...
Oh my God, shut up!
C'mon nigga, sing with me man!
Do you remember?
No! Shut up, nigga! Jesus Christ!
Are you serious? ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
Because the last time I checked, you just told me you fucked my bitch!
You expect me to be happy with you right now?!
Nigga, I should be mad at you, nigga
If anything, I haven't seen one stench of pussy since we got to this planet nigga
Get the fuck outta here, man
What? What happened to the brochure, nigga?
I mean...
I ain't seen shit! So shut the fuck up and sing this song!
I felt... I'm not singing this shit
Do you remember when we-
Shut up! Shh! Shut up! What's that?
[*dog barking*]
Oh shit!
(Who's that?)
Fuck!
What do we do?
(Who is that?)
I dunno, what the fuck do we do?
Shut up, I got this! I've been watching movies
You sure?
Trust me!
(Oh shit)
What's up man? Ayy, how you doing sir?
How you doing, sir?
[*gunshot*]
Oh damn! Hey, you almost shot us!
(What you motherfuckas doing in my backyard?)
Sir, just put the gun down! We didn't know it was your backyard, man
(Give me one reason why I shouldn't blow yo motherfucking head off!)
Aight look, I know it's gonna sound crazy
Shut up! Don't say it!
(Leave my lawn!)
But we're not human
Aww shit! You fucked us up!
(What?! Not human?)
No! No! No!
[*gunshot*]
Aight, sir, sir, sir!
(I don't wanna hear that shit)
We homeless, we got nowhere to go, I don't even know why we here
Please sir!
(Shut up!)
We just happened to be in your yard
Please, cut us some slack!
(Hmm... Shut up! Man, you two motherfuckas are in the wrong place, at the wrong goddamn time)
I know
(At the wrong hour, wearing the wrong shit!)
It's his fault, please!
(You know what? I ain't gon kill ya)
You're not?
(You two youngsters sit down and have a seat)
Sit yo ass down!
Thank you, thank you sir
(Don't give me that "thank you" shit, sit yo ass down!
Now, I'm guessing y'all ain't never heard the story of Ross Capicchioni, huh?)
Ross Cappachini?
Cappuccino?
Nigga I said Ross Capicchioni!
Aight, Capicchioni!
(Well, it all happened on one Sunday afternoon...)
