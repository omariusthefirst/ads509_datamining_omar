Your Heart

Joyner Lucas & J. Cole Lyrics
"Your Heart"
[Joyner Lucas:]
Mm
I'm sorry (Yeah)
I'm sorry (Yeah)
I broke your heart, huh?
You knew I was a fuck-nigga from the start, huh?
You should've listened when they said I was a dawg, huh
You should've listened to your head when you had thoughts, huh
That's what you thought, huh
I left you scarred, yeah
You never be the same again, put that on God, huh
I took your heart and then I tore that shit apart, huh
I fucked you over, did you dirty, did you wrong, huh
I did you wrong, huh, I did you wrong, yeah
You say you hate me but I know that this resolve, yeah
Angry texts, we don't ever get along, yeah
We been rockin' with each other for so long, yeah
Maybe that's why it's been harder to move on, yeah
And you changed too (Changed)
And your mama and your friends think I'm to blame too
And you hate it when somebody say my name, ooh
Every time you hear my name you wanna drink, ooh, ooh, ooh
You wanna get out, you wanna get drunk, you wanna get lit, lit
You wanna get crazy, do everything that you never did (Did)
You wanna get bent, you want the revenge, you wanna get dick
But you ain't about that life, so you might fuck a bitch (Bitch)
You might, you might break a window
You might do some wild shit out of impulse
You say that you hate me and we're not involved
But you still checkin' on me tryna find info, I know
I broke your heart, huh?
You knew I was a fuck-nigga from the start, huh?
You should've listened when they said I was a dawg, huh
You should've listened to your head when you had thoughts, huh
That's what you thought, huh
I left you scarred, yeah
You never be the same again, put that on God, huh
I took your heart and then I tore that shit apart, huh
I fucked you over, did you dirty, did you wrong, huh
I did you wrong, huh, I did you wrong, huh
[J. Cole:]
I hate a fuck-nigga, used to be a fuck-nigga
Couldn't even blame her if she did fuck niggas
You run your bitch through the mud, you deserve that
So you can feel it for yourself where it hurt at
What goes around comes around, I know you heard that
While you was creepin', tell me, did it not occur that
There's niggas slidin' in the DMs every AM, every PM?
Used to be like automatic, she would curve that
That was before when you was loyal
Now it's thirst traps on her profile and niggas know how to
Spot a chink in your armor, you been trippin', dawg
You ain't been keepin' your permits, you been pimpin', dawg
Now bitches wink in your comments, she's suspicious, dawg
And now you reap in your commas, she got niggas, dawg
Callin' her phone while you gone and your bitch-ass
Can't even feel no way 'cause you doin' her the same
Now you know the pain
And we used to be the dynamic duos in flames
And you too proud to see that you hold the blame
From all that playin', nigga, we too old for games, mane
You broke her heart, huh?
When you met her, she was young and hella pure, huh
Ain't had no clue that she was fuckin' with a dawg, huh
You never thought you'd see the day that she was gone, huh
But you was wrong, huh, yeah, you was wrong, huh
'Cause now as of late she ain't answerin' your calls, huh
She VIP, she out here fuckin' with your star sign
Some other nigga got it now, he 'bout to spoil her
You could've spoiled her, and bitch you starved her, yeah
