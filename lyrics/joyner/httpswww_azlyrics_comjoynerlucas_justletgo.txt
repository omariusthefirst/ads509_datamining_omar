Just Let Go

Joyner Lucas & Chris Brown Lyrics
"Just Let Go"
[Joyner Lucas:]
Yeah, yeah
Wait, it's your way
Pour some drinks, just a couple (Hol' up)
I know you been through pain
Did some things, I can't undo (Joyner)
You don't need no stress, let me take away your troubles (Yeah)
You gon' make me call my ex and let her know how much I love you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)
I love your piece of mind (Yeah)
I love your conscious, ain't no options
My apple meets the eyes (Hol' up)
Ain't no stoppin', damn my heart's been back and forth
Trapped in board, on the magic floor, behind the padded door (Yeah)
All my emotions in the attic stored, inside the bag of orbs, in the cabin draw
And you wonder why a nigga playing hard to get (So hard to get)
That shit's hard to fix
I just want peace and some common sense
And I really ain't into the arguing
So I hope you not upset (Yeah, yeah)
I know you not done yet (Yeah, yeah)
And I know you like drunk sex (Yeah, yeah)
I hope you ain't cum yet (Haha)
You wanna hop up on me like dubstep
Then pop up on me like drug test
But I'm livin' and I learn how to love less
Wanna hit me where it hurts like a cup check
Oh, damn that's painful (Woo)
Thats okay then (Woo)
Yeah, my future (Woo), That's So Raven
That's amazing, we divine
Lemme free your soul, lemme ease your mind
[Chris Brown:]
Baby, hit me up and call me any time
Don't be restless, let your problems be my problems
I don't mind it
Put your panties and your pride to the side
Want you to fuck with me (Alright)
Open the door on your side
You ain't gotta keep on fightin'
Just let go-o-o-o-o-o... and enjoy your time here
The devil nah, no-o-o-o-o-o-o...
Never leave, never leave
You ain't listenin', no
Girl, I ain't whisperin', come on
This ain't no whistlin' shit, no, no
'Cause I'ma yell a little louder
Now can you hear me?
'Cause you ain't listenin'
Why you gotta do it the hard way?
You don't wanna smoke or pressure
'Cause I'm gon' do it my way
I was tryna love you better
Girl, I know you've been hurt before
You been treated bad, you been taken advantage of
I know, I know I drive you crazy, babe
I curse you out, I don't mean what I say
And I can't get how you keep kickin' me out
You just need me now
You worried 'bout sex, I be weedin' 'em out
Make 'em fear me now
And I make a change, I pull up in that Wraith
All this ice on the beach, I just put on them skates
Titanic, that diamond, I put in the safe
Hit an iceberg and climate's be in the heat
And damn, my love's enormous, leave when I'm performin'
Not scared of heights, I'm soarin'
And you know now I'm woke, bitch
Baby, hit me up and call me any time
Don't be restless, let your problems be my problems
I don't mind it
Put your panties and your pride to the side
Want you to fuck with me (Alright)
Open the door on your side
You ain't gotta keep on fightin'
Just let go-o-o-o-o-o... and enjoy your time here
The devil nah, no-o-o-o-o-o-o...
Never leave, never leave
You ain't listening, no
Girl, I ain't whispering, come on
This ain't no whistling shit, no, no
'Cause I'ma yell a little louder
Now can you hear me?
'Cause you ain't listening
[Joyner Lucas:]
You ain't listenin' (Hol' up, hol' up)
You ain't heard me (What? What?)
You don't get it (Hol' up, hol' up)
You concern me (Yeah, yeah)
We just different, we in love but we be searchin' (Yeah, yeah)
You be trippin', I be buggin', we ain't perfect, yeah (What? What?)
I love your peace of mind (Woo)
I love your conscious, ain't no options
My apple meets the eyes (Woo)
Ain't no stoppin', damn, my heart's been back and forth (Back and forth)
Yeah, back and forth, side to side
You ain't listenin', we alright, lemme free yo soul (We alright)
Lemme ease your mind
[Chris Brown:]
Baby, hit me up and call me any time
Don't be restless, let your problems be my problems
I don't mind it
Put your panties and your pride to the side
Want you to fuck with me (Alright)
Open the door on your side
You ain't gotta keep on fightin'
Just let go-o-o-o-o-o... and enjoy your time here
The devil nah, no-o-o-o-o-o-o...
