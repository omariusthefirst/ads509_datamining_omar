Suge (Remix)

Joyner Lucas & Tory Lanez Lyrics
"Suge (Remix)"
[Joyner Lucas:]
Yeah, ain't no one colder than me (Yeah)
I'm straight from the mud, I got me a plug
And now I be rollin' with Meech (Woah, woah)
You think you the shit? I think you a bitch
Now go 'head and call the police (Bitch)
These niggas a trip, your homie's a snitch
He'll probably be home in a week (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I hit up Tory and told him, "I know you don't like me but fuck it I'm over the beef" (Word)
Told 'em we could be friends, invited him over and gave him some soda and bleach (Haha)
They said, "Joyner you lost it"
I told them they soft
Now go take a stroll on the beach (Yeah)
Nigga, I get the sauce, bitch, I'm a dog
Just don't get a hold of my leash (Ruff)
Y'all niggas back to the bluffin' (Blah)
Joyner get back to the bustin' (Blah)
If I do not make a few million this year then I might just go back to the hustlin'
I got me some product and I ain't gon' hide it
I might just start trappin' in public
I might go to prison and free all my niggas
That's word to Harriet Tubman
Tired of you askin' me questions, I'm sick of it (Buh, buh)
"Why you keep shuttin' shit down on the internet? (Grra)
Why do you have so much talent and benefits?
Why you keep droppin' your album in increments?"
A.D.H.D. is a social experiment
Who pay attention the most when they hearin' it?
You cannot stop it, there's no interferin' it
This is my moment and no one is sharin' it
Nigga, I'm just gettin' started, I hit all my targets
I promise I'm very defiant (Yeah)
If I do not win the Grammy this year then I'll blow that bitch up and then everyone dyin' (Yeah)
I think all my shit is hot, if everyone think that it's not then everyone lyin'
I hope my shit doesn't flop, 'cause I'll put a gun to your head and make everyone buy it
I'm diggin' the hole you get buried inside (Woo), or you get buried in silence
The day that I die I get buried in diamonds
I'm killin' you niggas, you barely survivin' (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I think I'm so high, I could marry a pilot
I'm Area 51 alien, I let my UFO fly in, it's scary and violent
I shut down the planet, you hearin' the sirens (Buh, buh)
I'm very excited and you shouldn't bother (Woo)
Joyner got too many problems (Word)
I told that little bitch that I'm down with a threesome as long as it's you and your mama (Yeah)
I ain't got no patience, I love to get dirty
But fuck it I'm cool with the drama (Cool)
When niggas be hatin', I tell them, "No worries my nigga, Hakuna Matata"
I don't wear Prada, just bring me a white tee (Buh)
I bust some Margiela's, I still wear the Nikes (Grra, grra)
I roll with some hitters, I know you don't like me
I shit on you niggas, now bring me some wipeys (Grra, grra)
You think I'm a killer? Well maybe I might be
I ain't got no feelings I dare you to fight me (Buh)
I'll swing with a left but I'm really a righty
Get pussy and money, it barely excites me
I'm ready, don't try me, so bow
Fuck all you pricks
You cannot harm me, I think you a bitch
You think I'm corny? I think I'm the shit
When she get horny, she tickle my dick
When I was broke, I would think like I'm rich
'Til I fucked up my credit and hit me a lick (Woo, woo, woo)
Then I got me some money to get me a crib
And then blew it on bitches from Plenty of Fish (Fuck was I thinkin'?)
I'm goin' back to the streets (Yeah)
If Freddy and Jason had babies, my nigga I promise then that would be me (Word)
Niggas all in my honey and actin' all funny, I think I'm attracted to bees
They told me that I changed, I looked in the mirror like what the fuck happened to me?
Ever since I done came up, these niggas been so in their feelings
They countin' my pockets I know that it's killin' 'em
Don't tell me you proud when you know that you jealous
The money keep pilin' I know that you smell it
You think you entitled? Well suck on a dick and I hope that you swallow
And that's how I'm feelin', put that on the Bible
Don't call me your family, you know you're my rival I do what I gotta
Now turn the fuckin' TV up, I'm in the media
And ain't nobody wanna see me up, a nigga heating up
I'm like a sickle cell anemia, I really mean it
But I'm 'bout to slow a nigga breathin' up, I think he's seen enough (Buh, buh, buh)
I go to hell, I fuck a demon up, I think I'm mean enough
To beat a nigga with Adidas 'til I fuck the sneakers up (Yeah)
I'll sucker-punch you when I'm sneakin' up
You couldn't see me but I had to hit 'em like a meteor (Boom, boom, boom)
And make 'em giddy up, to get the trunk
And I went from nothing to somethin'
I fell in love with the guns and I got a hundred and one (Brrratat)
And like every day that I'm bustin' I'm putting one in your stomach
I got 'em jumping and running, you better cover and duck (Brrratat)
And I'm not the one to be fucked with
I'm not the one that you think you could do whatever you want to (Brrratat)
There's gonna be repercussions
The enemies know what's up and I'm up at three in the mornin'
When you be sleepin' and yawnin', you know the evil be callin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Somebody better call the ambulance or the E-M-T (Yeah)
Nigga, I'm the bomb like T-N-T
Bet I roll up on a nigga with a G-M-C (Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat)
Get to clappin' on 'em, end of it, the E-N-D
Call the plug, tell him that I want at least ten keys
Now I'm back in business, E-P-M-D (Woo)
Couldn't walk in my shoes with a street stampede
Can't walk this way, I Run D-M-C (Yeah, yeah)
[Tory Lanez:]
Pack in the mail, I sit it down and it's crackin' the scale
Had to switch position from the kitchen, nigga, I was flippin' like a spatula there
Pretty Ricky with them bitches, when I'm hittin' long as a dread on spectacular hair
Here shit, light shit, white whip, open up it look like a packet of mayo
I'm back in Rodeo, fuckin' up the check and chuckin' up the set
And I'm back off the layover, pay-over way over niggas
No slumber but a nigga stay over, nigga
Your bitch is with me 'til the day-day, AK loaded up the same way
Chain swang, white person screamin' out, "Gang gang!"
Slide or kick, Jet Li or Liu K-K-Kang (Wah!)
I got a Little B, he call me based God like brring, ding, ding
Got a main dame, Audemar, and that's my main thang
Got a Rollie watch, her name Jane but she plain plain, so we call her plain Jane
Over her, I let it bang-bang like the fingers twistin' on a gang member sittin' in the chain gang
Nigga, please, I got old nigga cheese, y'all got hoe nigga knees
Can't let a faux nigga roll up, put a hole in your shit then let the ho nigga leave, man
Y'all niggas know a nigga T-O-R-Y, all my niggas got paws and they're always for the free
"O" for the fee, if a nigga throw a couple Gs, get a little nigga smoked for the free, man
1-5-0, first show, nigga, that's how I go, I was chosen with those melodies
Niggas hatin', I've been goin' up with those enemies
And the snakes keep blowin' it with those in the breeze
I'm up to no good, my boy's in the hood
With no young Jeezy, and no Jody Breezy, could blow 40 Gs
Still come back, who the fuck lookin' like the Ol' Dirty B from the Wu-Tang, nigga?
I could say nothin' on a motherfuckin' track, still go back plat' like Pootie Tang, nigga
Do your thing, nigga, hoppin' in the Mulsanne
Hotter than a blue flame lit up in the full tank, nigga
Man niggas better hide, niggas what, niggas what?
Nigga, niggas at the bottom of the food chain, nigga
Nigga so lame, can't crew hang, nigga, can't crew bang with ya, can't move a thang with ya'
See a little bad bitch walkin' down the block, but she lookin' at me 'cause your crew can't get her
I'm a dominator, moderator
Pass your chick like hot potato
Police non-cooperator
I won't tolerate a bitch that's talkin' crazy, not me, lil' nigga
I be on the beach with the sea, lil' nigga
I been triplin' up the doubles and threes, lil' nigga
Livin' it up with the women up in Vis, lil' nigga
Give it up all my niggas is tuckin', I hope a nigga's duckin'
I been drippin' and drippin' like a nigga's tippin' the bucket
I been whippin' these bitches and stickin' out my dick in public
They be lickin' a nigga to get to familiar fuckin'
I be fuckin' these women in ten-percent'd tinted windows
And I'm yellin' and tellin' I gotta get it, get to steppin'
I'm reppin' Umbrella forever, my niggas in abundance
I'm fly as propellers, you jealous
And if a nigga comin', I'm eatin' these niggas like ketchup and relish on a bun
I got the money to fund the wonders of what I wanted
And when I want it, I wanna feel like you can't front on it
I got your ex-chick and your next chick on a pole in my livin' room floor tryin' to dance all on it
As long as I can put my hands all on her, she said: "Handstand, a handstand'' and landed on it
I said damn, had to put it in her head, I ain't droppin' no bread
This is not that Gretel and the Hansel story
Got a Coupe full of hoes and the hose in the Coupe
To the Lamborghini doors to the floors and the roof
When I'm goin' in the booth, I'm exposin' the globe to the truth
They be knowin', I be showin' up with proof
Any faux nigga, any ho nigga, any low Joe Schmoe nigga better know
When I unload Get Low, Get Low, Get Low like Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz, nigga
And my lil' bitch type thick, uh
Neck is freezy as a ice-pick, uh
Out of sect just like a high kick, uh
Niggas gonna copy my style like a right click
All of my dogs'll kill you like Mike Vick
Light that pistol, put that boy in a Heimlich
I was handin' them Ls to Joyner and Don for comin' out actin' too lightskin
Nigga, I'm back in the Bentley, applyin' the pressure
Spittin' bunch of flyin' and firin' embers
So fuckin' hot, you'd think I died in the desert
Came back to fuck up your entire endeavor
You tryin' me? Never; your squad will get shot if ya try and be clever
My diamonds forever, designin' and linin' a bed up
Then give 'em a choice: which one you want die with, the .9 or Beretta?
I'm sorry for being intolerant, I got this violent temper
I like when I'm cold, I shoot a nigga, make him die in December
You been a bitch, as long as I can remember
You sayin' that you're gang, them niggas keep talkin'
I promise I'll silence your members then quiet your temple
While firing bullets that fly at your mental and pry at your denim
I'll hire somebody to fire the jet up then get up and send a shooter that'll fly if you rattle
I promise I'm high on momentum
Might think it's a setup, but find me a nigga
Might line that nigga for the paper
Let the hitter get to foldin', origami the nigga
The Louie luggage bustin' down on ya nigga
But true we thuggin', no insomnia, nigga
I'm really a top 3...
Man, hold on, I'm just rappin' too much, man, fuck this shit
