Ultrasound

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Ultrasound"
Yo, wassup, this is Joyner, I'm unable to take your call right now, leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
You know, you really piss me off sometimes
I spent all night waiting for you to come home
And I've woken up without you
I don't know where you are or why you are not answering your phone
But I'm starting to get worried
I really hope you're not pissing away the last of our money at the stupid casino again
Because you know my next check won't be here till the third and we literally have nothing right now
If you did go to the casino and you have more money then...
I guess...
Get the fuck off of my dick, hoe
'Fuck you mean?
I don't think you notice what you done to me (yeah)
Yeah I think you should know that you were under me
If anybody got a problem tell 'em they can come to me
What the fuck you mean? This is not allowed
Better calm it down
'Cause all you new niggas just watered down
I can see through you like a muthafuckin' ultrasound ooh
Okay be ready to hold up then
I'm ready to roll up on them, ready to mow them, make your motor spin
I'll blow the boat up then be gone and wonderin' what you noticing
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was only ten
I'm tryina' to get all up in that pussy harder than my youngin' (wo)
You fallin' and you love it (yeah)
Can't stand the heat but you up all in the oven (sha)
I remember when I used to ball on a budget
(Hol' up) Now wait a minute
You finally got some paper couldn't wait to get it (ya)
And it don't really matter 'cause you're still lame
No matter how much cake you got, it wouldn't make a difference (don't matter)
I'm tired of all you rappers wantin' free verses
The fuck up outta here this how I make a livin'
(That's how I make a livin')
I dive up in that pussy like Jamaican niggas
I spend all of my dollars on some Laker tickets (yup)
I think if I die young they gon' miss me too
I think I'm a buy guns maybe empty too (bla bla bla)
I think I'm a sell drugs to the kids at school
I think I'm a get buzzed if it gets me through
I think I'm a need to hide if they know where I live (yeah)
I think I'm a drink and drive til' I total the whip (whoa)
I think I'm a get high give her all of the dick
Even if she ain't mine so she knows what it is, wait
(She know what it is)
Hold up though
I'm ready to roll up on them, ready to mow them, make your motor boat
I blow the boat up, then be gone, I'm wonderin' what you notice though
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was on it though
My nigga what's your worst fear? I been running from the start
Scared to be a man, tryna hustle in the dark
Running down the stairs, gotta hustle every March
Eating supper, getting filled, watch it rumble in the Bronx
I slip inside into the puddle of your heart
Nigga I don't trust you plus you never play the part
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, nigga
I said
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, hold up
I been living in the-
Yeah
Look
Get the fuck off of my dick
Wait a minute (wait a minute)
I'm a fuck your bitch to let my neighbor hit it (neighbor hit it)
She told me "maybe we could go on a date"
I told her "no way, but we could say we did it"
I'm such a lost soul, even my mom knows
That's why she hate a nigga (hate a nigga)
I'm such an asshole, even Superman, couldn't save a nigga
(Joyner)
Get the fuck off-
Of my cock
Yo, wassup, this is Joyner, I'm unable to take your call right now, leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
