I Lied (Intro)

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"I Lied (Intro)"
Buck, buck, buck
I think I was born inside the cabana
With diamonds and gold on top of the Phantom
Jesus told Mary, "Go get me a hammer"
I'll kill any nigga that try and to get near him
All of the angles was drinkin' tequila
And Michael was sleepin' with Dirty Diana
And now I can't look at the man in the mirror
My life is a movie and here is the trailer
I ain't no killer, but don't try to play me
I'm out off my pills and now just I'm crazy
I jumped out of Heaven 'cause Lucifer paid me
I needed the money to buy a Mercedes
I fucked a few bitches, I had me a baby
I hope that my son don't grow up to hate me
I'm out of my mind and no one can save me
I wish I-
Back when a nigga was jobless
Tryna get by, plottin' on shootin' myself (Buck, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I can stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All of them promises I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Whatever she want, consider it done
Soon as I'm rich, I'll buy you a crib
And get you a whip, whatever you want
Promise my niggas, I'll give you a million
A couple of cars just so you can stunt
Then I got famous, blew up my head
And fuck what I said, my nigga, I'm gone
Hop out the foreign and jump in the stretch
Life is a bitch, I fuck her to death
And how do I feel? I'm so much depressed
I'll probably get killed, but fuck it, I'm blessed
Nigga, I'm rich, I'm done with the stress
Now I got drip, and blood niggas sweat
They love when I drip, they want me in debt
Go choke on a dick and cut me a check
All of these meds done got me a fever
I wanted a chain but got me a Visa
I came in the game, just droppin' my feet up
You niggas is strange, you follow the leader
And me and my pistol like Martin and Gina
We plot on you niggas, I'm probably a schemer
I'm easy to hate, I'm harder to love
You say you don't trust me, I wouldn't either, woah (Buck, buck, buck)
I had to move back at home, my momma was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I lock myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full (Buck, buck)
But, I didn't mean it
Back when a nigga was jobless
Tryna get by, plottin' on shootin' myself (Buck, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I can stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All of them promises I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I just put some gold Dayton's on my fuckin' Benzo
Hit the switches, told your bitch, "Come fuck me 'cause I said so"
They say, "Joyner, you done changed, you done lost your mental
You blew up and all that humble shit went out the window"
I ain't the same, I used to be different
They say that I changed, well, maybe you right
Maybe them pills the doctor prescribed me, got me wanna kill, and maybe I might
Maybe my family upset 'cause I made it
'Cause no one expected that I would be famous
And just 'cause we blood don't mean we're related
I'm threatin' the plug
I'm not with the fake shit, I'm not with the-
Grandma told me, "Tone it down"
I said, "Bitch, I'm older now"
I ate at my auntie house
She think that I owe her now
Cash my check, got paid again
Bank estate, I'm open now
Took my girl to H&M, she told me, "It's over now" (Buck, buck, buck)
I had to move back at home, my momma was heated (Buck, buck, buck)
I lock myself in the room to hide all my demons (Buck, buck, buck)
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full (Buck, buck)
But, I didn't mean it
Back when a nigga was jobless
Tryna get by, plottin' on shootin' myself (Buck, buck, buck)
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself (Buck, buck, buck)
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself (Buck, buck, buck)
But fuck it, I lied, and now I can stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? (Buck, buck, buck)
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All of them promises I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
