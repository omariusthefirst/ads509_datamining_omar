Father's Day (Skit)

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Father's Day (Skit)"
[Teacher:]
So today is Father's Day
And I asked you guys to create a beautiful card for your fathers today
I'm sure your dad would love this!
I'm just going to quietly walk around the room, and look at the wonderful card you made
[Teacher:]
This is beautiful
This is nice
[Kid:]
Thanks
[Teacher:]
Sandra, I love this one!
Is that a picture of you and your dad?
[Kid:]
Yeah that's me and my dad
[Teacher:]
That's beautiful
Nice, nice!
[Kid:]
Thank you!
[Teacher:]
Oh well, Joyner, what is this?
This part says "Happy Father's Day, stepdad"
Why don't you create one for your real dad?
[Joyner:]
I don't have a real dad
[Teacher:]
Well isn't that unfortunate? That explains a lot
So anyone with a real dad, take you cards and place them in your backpack
Joyner, I'm gonna hold on to yours, and maybe one day
You'll have a change of heart
Remember, you only get one dad
Keep that in mind
[Joyner:]
Yeah, yeah
