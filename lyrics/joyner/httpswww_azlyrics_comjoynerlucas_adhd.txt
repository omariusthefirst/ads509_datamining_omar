ADHD

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"ADHD"
It kinda feels like I'm dyin' on the inside
It kinda feels like I been tryna get by
And I been this way since day one
I don't need no medication
No, I don't need no drugs
What? Maybe I'm different
And maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah
I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I think crazy?
Someone save me
You can't blame me
It's my ADHD
Yeah, my mind racin', I been paranoid
Overthinking, maybe that's a void
Don't cut me off like I don't have a voice
I think I was born different
I ain't really have a choice, yeah
Counsellin' session, you a hour late
Don't play with me, today is not the day
Pay attention, I am no deranged
I could tell you what I'm thinkin'
I just don't know how to say it
Maybe I get on yo' nerves
I mean what I say
I been a man of my word
Yeah, I'm wide awake
Maybe a little disturbed
But that's just me
You don't bleed the blood I bleed
I wear my heart on my sleeve, nigga
And I been this way since day one
I don't need no medication
No, I don't need no drugs
What? Maybe I'm different
And maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah
I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I think crazy?
Someone save me
You can't blame me
It's my ADHD
Yeah, it kinda feels like I'm dyin' on the inside
It kinda feels like I been tryna get by
Yippie, yippie, ya, yo
Yippie, ya, ya
Starin' at the fire, Kumbaya
I'ma take you higher, take you higher
I'ma take you higher, take you higher
So many things in my head
What am I thinkin'?
How come I can't go sleep in my bed?
I hear them talkin', everyone's tryin' to
Leave me for dead
'Cause they want me gone
This that shit I be on
Ain't no one to lean on
They know I been this way since day one
I don't need no medication
Or maybe I'm on one
Or maybe I'm different
And maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah
I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I think crazy?
Someone save me
You can't blame me
It's my ADHD
Yeah, it kinda feels like I'm dyin' on the inside
