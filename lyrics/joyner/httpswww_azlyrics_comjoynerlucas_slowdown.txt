Slow Down

Elijah James & Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Slow Down"
[Elijah James:]
I can't follow you into the darkness
And I can't follow you into the grave
If you want to go that way
You can go alone
Oh if you want to roll that way
Just know that I won't come
I know that I am different
And you don't understand
But it's because I'm different
I'll rise and rule the land
Aye, aye
They think I need to Slow Down
Think I need to slow down
Think I need to slow down
Think I need to slow down
Oh, I think I know now
Oh, I think I know now
Oh, I think I know now
Words will keep your soul bound
Oh, if you want to go that way, you can go alone
Oh, if you want to roll that way
Just know that I won't come
[Joyner Lucas:]
Look, you got an attitude (Yeah)
I hate when you get mad when I'm mad at you
I think you should relax with the latitude
And we done did a lot of things for the gratitude
Cheers to the days I was in a stressful place
Running up the bank, moving next to Chase (Yeah)
And broke bitches always got expensive taste
She gon' suck me off and see how expensive taste
You'll be my bae and my confidant (Yeah)
Struggle through the pain and the ramidon
I could be your slave and your Amistad
Love the way you move your waste when my song is on (Uh-huh)
Uh-huh, you the baddest
And I'ma hype you up like some ad-libs (Hol' up)
And I can't get enough of your assets
I hope to God you ain't nothing like my last bitch
Can't gas me, I'm a Tesla (Tesla)
She just wants rules and affection (Affection)
Then tell me what you do like Alexa (No)
But I ain't really cool with the extras
Blessed to be living and my mind is clear (Yeah)
Tryna chase you but ain't no time to spare (Well)
I don't know where I'm going but I'll find you there (Yeah)
And we can make love every time you're here (Yeah)
[Elijah James:]
They think I need to Slow Down
Think I need to slow down
Think I need to slow down
Think I need to slow down
Oh, I think I know now
Oh, I think I know now
Oh, I think I know now
Words will keep your soul bound
They think I need to Slow Down
Think I need to slow down
Think I need to slow down
Think I need to slow down
Oh, I think I know now
Oh, I think I know now
Oh, I think I know now
Words will keep your soul bound
I can't follow you into the darkness
And I can't follow you into the grave
