10 Bands

Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"10 Bands"
(feat. Timbaland)
10 bands, 20 bands, she'll do anything for a couple grand
Never had no money but she love to dance (What)
I give all my money back to Uncle Sam
My ex bitch still want another chance (What)
Man, I swear I'll never fall in love again
I done came up, I'm the fuckin' man (What)
Me and Timbaland got other plans
You don't really know what you up against
But you know I'll always have the upper hand
You ain't never been through the struggle, man
Homemade grits in the oven pan
You don't run shit, you don't wanna dance (No)
Two shots, make 'em do the 'Running Man'
And they say love is a drug (Uh-huh)
Man, I swear I'll never take drugs again
Traded my bike for a hooptie (Hooptie)
Traded my hooptie for a Honda (Honda)
Traded my Honda for a Panther
I just got a crib in Wakanda (Wooh)
I never been into the drama (Drama)
Never been a fan of designer (Ugh)
All I really got is one wish (What's that?)
A one night stand with Madonna
Think I gotta hit 'em with the head bust
This is for them days when they made me ride the motherfuckin' spare bus (Uh-huh)
And this is for them days when my teachers told me I should go and sell drugs
Niggas went to jail, ain't nobody put the bail up
Shorty had the money but she went and got her hair done
Niggas hating on me, but I never really cared much (God damn)
10 bands, 20 bands, she'll do anything for a couple grand
Never had no money but she love to dance (What)
I give all my money back to Uncle Sam
My ex bitch still want another chance (What)
Man, I swear I'll never fall in love again
And they say love is a drug
I done brought the hitters out to play
I don't like you, you don't like me
Fuck it, let's get it out the way
What we gon' do? What it's gon' be?
I just got a million out the bank (Uh-huh)
Spoil my son, do what I please
Fuck what any nigga got to say (Uh-huh)
Lay in the sun, kick up my feet
I just might pull up in a mink (Mink)
Take my enemies out to drink (What)
Toss my weapons in the lake
Count up my blessings and I'm straight (Nah)
I think I might go on a date
Count all my dough in the safe, roll with the weight
Lookin' my soul in the face, they don't even know what to say
I just want
10 bands, 20 bands, she'll do anything for a couple grand
Never had no money but she love to dance (What)
I give all my money back to Uncle Sam
My ex bitch still want another chance (What)
Man, I swear I'll never fall in love again
Someone said love is a drug (Uh-huh)
Men lie, women lie, niggas lie, yeah
I'ma ride long as I'm alive, woah
Homicide, kill 'em like genocide (Yuh)
Get it on camera, televised (Woah)
ADHD, I identify (Ugh)
Look at my feelings, I'm civilized (Yeah)
Analyze and I might spend the night with a dyke
And the right bitch if I hit it right
I remember scraping up the quarters (Quarters)
Drinking from the sink to get some water
Tryna pay the rent, I couldn't afford it
Stressing made a nigga bi-polar (Uh-huh)
Washing machine out of order
Nigga had to hustle on the corner
Now, I'm back and forth from the border
Saving up hoes like a hoarder
10 bands, 20 bands, she'll do anything for a couple grand
Never had no money but she love to dance (What)
I give all my money back to Uncle Sam
My ex bitch still want another chance (What)
Man, I swear I'll never fall in love again
I done came up, I'm the fuckin' man (What)
Me and Timbaland got other plans
You don't really know what you up against
But you know I'll always have the upper hand
You ain't never been through the struggle, man
Homemade grits in the oven pan
You don't run shit, you don't wanna dance (No)
Two shots, make 'em do the 'Running Man'
Someone said love is a drug
I don't ever want to take drugs again
