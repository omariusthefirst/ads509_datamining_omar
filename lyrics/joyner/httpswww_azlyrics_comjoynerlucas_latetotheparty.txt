Late To The Party

Joyner Lucas & Ty Dolla $ign Lyrics
"Late To The Party"
(Ayy, ayy)
(Joyner, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner)
Feels like I did so much dirt I don't believe in karma
Did so much dirt I had to sleep with armor
All these niggas fuck around, someone better warn 'em
Like just roll up with that chopper, they ain't see it comin'
And I ain't scared of shit, don't wanna see your honor
Just broke up with my bitch, I don't believe in drama
Plus she for the streets, so I don't even want her
'Bout to show your true colors, it ain't even autumn
I got me some money, I needed the coupe, needed the coupe
Bought it, don't loan, just me and my dues
And nigga like me never needed the groove
And nigga like me never needed to shoot, I got the shooters
They pull the trigger and hit your medulla
This ain't no bullet that you can maneuver
I got them jumpin' right out they Pumas, it wasn't no rumor
I took his chain and called him an Uber
I got the band, and got the bazooka
This for them days I was scrapin' for change
And would do anything just to get me some mula
I'm sick and tired of these niggas callin' me a sellout 'cause I took a trip to the jeweler
And I just filled a hunnid on my wrist too
And yeah, I think I'm cocky 'cause I'm rich too
And yeah, I might just go up in your bitch too
Called that hoe my hook, yeah, I like skip school
I remember times we were kids too
Just some youngins gettin' high, we was lit too
Ain't no limit to the grind when them friends do
I got money on my mind and some bricks too
I been drinkin' all my pain 'til I'm crawlin'
Pour it 'til it's empty, lil' bad bitch with me
She don't wanna got to sleep 'til the mornin'
Mirrors on the sink, I been starin' at my face
I don't wanna be late to the party
Someone chill my mind, but I do this every time
I been drinkin' all this pain 'til I'm crawlin'
I don't wanna go to sleep 'til the mornin'
I don't wanna go to sleep
Rather do that when I'm dead and gone
Pop open some 42, she rather do the Ketel One
How she givin' me advice 'bout some shit
That she ain't never done
Smokin' Js to the face, I can't be gettin' high with everyone
Left and crashed the Porsche, that's okay bitch, I had insurance
Left and did some numbers, I came back and bought a Urus
Say that all she needed from me was a little assurance
She'll never find another man like me even with a thesaurus
Got more trees than a forest
Charge two-hundred K for the verse
Did another one for the chorus
Stackin' this money enormous, if she with Dolla, she gorgeous
If she with Dolla, for sure, she give me that head like a walrus
Most of these niggas sound the same these days
And that shit garbage
Big bro told me "Lil' homie, just be you regardless"
Came from them apartments
Now you the owner, that my 'partments
New Celine, yeah, whole collection in your closet
Tryna pick out somethin' for this party
I been drinkin' all my pain 'til I'm crawlin'
Pour it 'til it's empty, lil' bad bitch with me
She don't wanna got to sleep 'til the mornin'
Mirrors on the sink, I been starin' at my face
And I don't wanna be late to the party
Someone chill my mind, but I do this every time
I been drinkin' all this pain 'til I'm crawlin'
I don't wanna go to sleep 'til the mornin'
I been drinkin' all my pain 'til I'm crawlin'
Pour it 'til it's empty, lil' bad bitch with me
She don't wanna got to sleep 'til the mornin' (Mornin')
Mirrors on the sink, I been starin' at my face
I don't wanna be late to the party
Someone chill my mind, but I do this every time
I been drinkin' all this pain 'til I'm crawlin'
I don't wanna go to sleep 'til the mornin'
