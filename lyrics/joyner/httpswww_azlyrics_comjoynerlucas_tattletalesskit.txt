Joyner Lucas Lyrics
"Tattle Tales (Skit)"
[Christine:]
Excuse me, Ms. Nelson? Joyner said something mean to Cory
[Ms. Nelson:]
He did? Well, that wasn't very nice of him, was it?
Joyner
[Joyner Lucas:]
Yes, Ms. Nelson!
[Ms. Nelson:]
Can you come here, please?
[Joyner Lucas:]
Coming!
[Ms. Nelson:]
So I was just informed that you said something mean to Cory
[Joyner Lucas:]
That's not true, she's lying!
[Ms. Nelson:]
Joyner...
[Cory:]
Yeah, he did! He told me I was-
[Ms. Nelson:]
Now, before we figure out anything, I just wanna point out that what Christine came up and told me wasn't her business, was it?
[Joyner Lucas & Cory:]
No
[Ms. Nelson:]
And what Christine actually did was what?
[Joyner Lucas & Cory:]
Tattle taled
[Ms. Nelson:]
That's right! She tattle taled. And we don't like tattle tales very much, do we?
[Joyner Lucas & Cory:]
No
[Ms. Nelson:]
Cory, what's another name for tattle tale?
[Cory:]
Snitch!
[Ms. Nelson:]
That's right! Snitch. And what Christine just did was snitch on Joyner
[Cory:]
Aha!
[Ms. Nelson:]
And like the saying goes, "Snitches get" what?
[Joyner Lucas & Cory:]
"Stitches!"
[Ms. Nelson:]
Say it again! "Snitches get" what?
[Joyner Lucas & Cory:]
"Stitches!"
[Ms. Nelson:]
One more time! "Snitches get" what?
[Joyner Lucas & Cory:]
"Stitches! "
