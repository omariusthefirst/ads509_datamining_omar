Wyrd

Glass Animals Lyrics
"Wyrd"
Twee vole go dig your hole
Squish squirmies in your nose
Tree hairs in your eyes
You smile so super quiet
Free air you slip on
A cave edge, a black bowl
Breathing deep and slow
As your own splash echoes
You can't run so you must hide
You won't make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So my friend our time is done
You and I could've had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets, yeah...
Oh, vole where did you go?
Dim lanterns held by groans
Of beasties sad and tired
Lost in the muck and...
It's all dank and gross
Slugs on shrooms bubble smoke
Through pipes and mondo rolls
Their fuzzy warbles drone
Mmmm, baby
Mmmm, baby
Mmmm, baby please
Don't go
You can't run so you must hide
You won't make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So my friend our time is done
You and I could've had so much
With ropes for the buckets
Of luscious black gold nuggets
You can't run so you must hide
You won't make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So my friend our time is done
You and I could've had so much
With ropes for the buckets
Of luscious black gold nuggets, yeah...
