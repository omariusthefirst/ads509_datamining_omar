Tangerine (Remix)

Glass Animals Lyrics
"Tangerine (Remix)"
(feat. Arlo Parks)
As cold as an old ice cream sandwich
As focused as Mr. Miyagi
You poke at your phone postin' aerial photos
Of you with your smoothie
I can't keep on makin' you happy
'Cause you got issues with your daddy
I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you
And your gran in home movies
But I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?
I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need
Tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need
Tangerine
I wanna see you bloomin' like a tulip
With your head like peach
I'm readin' through your letters
I remember when you saw through me
And now within your pale blue eyes
There's nothin' I can keep
I used to know the way you smiled
And how you liked your tea
Now, you spirited away, catch a gleam in the eye
Of the ghost that you are
It'll never be okay, you're a star of the past
Gonna miss that sweet little tangerine
You've been dreamlessly sleepin' for years
Super clear since the late 1990s
You only look at me properly now
When you're drunk, watchin' movies
Where are you? What happened? I want what we had
Where you gone? Where you hidin'?
It's 2:23, you got Friends on repeat
On repeat, on repeat, on repeat
On repeat, on rep-
I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?
(I'm beggin', hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need
Tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need
Tangerine
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need
Tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need
Tangerine)
I'm beggin' hands, knees, please
Tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need
Tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please
Tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need
Tangerine
