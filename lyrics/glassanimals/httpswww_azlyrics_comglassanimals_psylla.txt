Psylla

Glass Animals Lyrics
"Psylla"
I wanna make it right
I wanna make you cry
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
Stop swaying when they move or shake it down
Makes mama turn her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying when they move or shake it down
Makes mama turn her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying when they move or shake it down
Makes mama turn her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying when they move or shake it down
Makes mama turn her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying when they move or shake it down
Makes mama turn her hands and flip around
Back lashing with a bullet full of love
Makes papa wanna chrome up his old truck
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
I follow suit, I follow suit
I follow suit, I follow
