Cocoa Hooves, Pt. II

Glass Animals Lyrics
"Cocoa Hooves, Pt. II"
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They've come to hold you, ain't that nice?
He packs a fat oom paul to
Jib and make home-baked perfume
Sip froth from soft, warm Joe
Snug eiderdown bedclothes
You know the way that I hide
You know
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They've come to hold you in the
You know the way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
You know the way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
Way that I hide
