Gold Lime

Glass Animals Lyrics
"Gold Lime"
Gold lime gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lime gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control
Now tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw
There was a crowd of seeds
Inside, outside
I must have done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
The weight, the shell was crushing you
I've been around a few
Now tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Gold lime gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lime gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control
Now tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw
There was a crowd of seeds
Inside, outside
I must have done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
The weight, the shell was crushing you
I've been around a few
Now tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
