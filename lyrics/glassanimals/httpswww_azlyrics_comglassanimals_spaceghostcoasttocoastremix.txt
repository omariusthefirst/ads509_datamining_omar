Space Ghost Coast To Coast (Remix)

Glass Animals & Bree Runway Lyrics
"Space Ghost Coast To Coast (Remix)"
I said to you, "Why did you do it?"
Touch the glass, I'll feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Red light, please stop
Got me moving like
Like a RoboCop
You're so insane
You done switched up
No, no, you ain't the same
I'll cut the ties
I can feel that evil eye, uh
What's this disguise?
Is it the rain or is it you cryin'?
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Were you bored of gender norms?
Of being alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own?
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road
We were just two Texas toddlers
PokÃ©mon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook, names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007, Nintendo, James
Bond, Hot Pockets in the microwave
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
(Living in the valley cuttin' porno)
