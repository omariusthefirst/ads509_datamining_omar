Woozy

Glass Animals Lyrics
"Woozy"
(feat. Jean Deaux)
[Verse 1: Jean Deaux]
Now can we place a bet
You love collect calls inside of your cigarettes
I still wonder why you can't seem
To get it yet
If we go half then maybe we can spend another night
Another day another chance for us to get right
Inside these walls we watch the tables turn
You say I should've had a mother
And watch my navel yearn
There are things that I expect you know
How you gone plant a whole seed and not expect it to grow?
We just smoking too much weed
I'm still expecting to blow
Let's take a walk
Don't forget your key baby
Let's say a prayer
Come on get down on your knees baby
Please A-ha
[x3]
Don't get up
[x3]
Please A-ha
[x3]
[Verse 2: Jean Deaux]
Theres no doubt
You know i want this
Just as much as you
What if you lyin
Then I'm just stuck here like a fuckin fool
Ill still be stuck even if
This is the fuckin truth
You say I'm running from my problems
But theres no other way
If you decide to keep it
I don't know if I'mma stay
My shoulders dislocating
Breaking under all is weight
I'm just thinkin bout your lateness
It's a bad time
I want to be situated before I have mine
Lets talk a walk
Don't forget your key baby
Let's say a prayer
Come on get down on your knees
Baby
Come on get down on your knees baby
(Please A-ha
[x3]
Don't get up
[x3]
Please A-ha
[x3]
Please A-ha
[x3]
Don't get up
[x3]
