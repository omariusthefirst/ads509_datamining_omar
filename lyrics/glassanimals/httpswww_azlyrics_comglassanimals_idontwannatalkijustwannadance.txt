I Don't Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance)

Glass Animals Lyrics
"I Don't Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance)"
(Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk no more)
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
We kissed in the morning on a summer day
You taste like cigarettes and hurricanes
There's a warning written in the corners of your face
Whiplash and you left me in a vapour trail
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway
(You say) You'd fall in love but you don't know how
We were good once but I'm fucked up now
(You say) I was done tryna work things out
I built the house and you burned it down
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
Just a minute now, there's something different now
All your moaning sounds, how's it all so loud?
Put the flowers down 'cause they look like clowns
Leave me to it then and let your hair grow out
Now I know it's safe to say
Nothing's perfect anyway
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
You'd fall in love but you don't know how
We were good once but I'm fucked up now
(You say) I was done tryna work things out
I built the house and you burned it down
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
I don't wanna talk, no more living in the past baby
Don't wanna talk baby, I just wanna dance
And I'm not gonna stop till I forget what we had
You'd fall in love but you don't know how
We were good once but I'm fucked up now
