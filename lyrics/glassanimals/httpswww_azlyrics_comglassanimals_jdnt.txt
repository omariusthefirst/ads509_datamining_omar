Glass Animals Lyrics
"JDNT"
Oooooooh...
I
Breathe
Air
And sigh
Tou...
...can
Sleeps
And cries
I'm all armored up
I've got my old helmet on
Keeping out an eye
Puffing all my feathers up
One more little blow
One more tap and I'll collapse
Teetering on a toe
I feel that final poke
Please, it's not okay
Oh can't you feel your dirty face
Oh don't it leave that filthy taste
When you squeeze that life untamed
I
Free
Fall
Real slow
I'm all drying out
Where my funny friends gone?
You're in paradise
Who's gonna plant the flowers huh?
Weak and worried I
Shut my wild eyes
And crumble to a pile
Of dust and fertilize
Please, it's not okay
Oh can't you feel your dirty face
Oh don't it leave that filthy taste
When you squeeze that life untamed
(Take my hand and let us fall)
Play with me and pass the ball
Take my hand and let us fall
Play with me and pass the ball
Take my hand and let us fall
I
Breathe
Air
And sigh
You
Can't
Breathe
Without me
